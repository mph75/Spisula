There are also stats for different chromosomes (ignored because I do not
have differentiated chromosomes)

<span style="color: red;">MPH: Very nice! Maintaining a chronological sequence, can you add the essentials of your Trinity results so it becomes clear why solidissima has so much more data?

Your duplication rate is very high - why do you think that might be?</span>

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](ProgressSummary_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
